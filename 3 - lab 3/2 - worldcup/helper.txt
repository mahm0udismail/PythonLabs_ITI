1 - google how to read dictionaries from CSV files
2 - load all teams into memory
3 - write simulate_tournament function implementation, by repeatedly calling simulate_round function on the teams, 
    until there's one team, return that one team
4 - simulate N number of tournaments (10, 100, 1000, 10000 ... etc), counting how many tournaments did that team win

   counts = {
	"Argentina": 500,
	"Brazil" : 400
}
