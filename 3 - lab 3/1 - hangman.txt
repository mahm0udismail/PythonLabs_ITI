Word guessing game (hangman):
A list of words will be hardcoded in your program, 
steps:
	- pick 1 random word
	- ask the user for his name
	- show the word with empty spots
	- continually ask the user to guess any alphabetical letter / or the word:
		if the word is correct:
			terminate the program and congratulate the player on winning
		elif the random word contains that letter:
			show all occurences of the letter in the correct spot (as well as previously correct guessed letters)
		else:
			let the user know he was wrong, and show the previous iteration of the correct guess letters
	- give the user maximum of 7 guess to complete the word


example:
please enter your name: "Abdallah"
the word that was picked is:  _ _ _ _ _ _ _
guess a letter: "a"
nice! that was in the word: _ a _ _ _ a _
