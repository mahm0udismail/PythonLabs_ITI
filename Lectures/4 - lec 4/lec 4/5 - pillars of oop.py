    1 - inheritance:
                    the process of not writing extra code for doing the same thing
                    Person -> SuperHero
                    SuperHero is a Person

    2 - abstraction:
                    the process of hiding the internal logic and implementation details
                    abstracting the implementation
                    you program on the specifications not the implementation
                    function -> str

                sort: < python 3.11 : TimSort -> TimPeters
                sort >= python 3.11 : PowerSort -> 2 scientists

    3 - encapsulation:
                    combining the data/attributes and the actions/methods that act on them.
                    encapsulating both the attributes and methods withing the object

    4 - polymorphism:
                    different shapes
                    the process of adapting the object or its attributes to different cases
