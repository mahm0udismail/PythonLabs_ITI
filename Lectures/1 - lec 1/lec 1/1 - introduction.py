difference between programming languages:

1 - syntax:
rules of writing the language.

2 - paradigm:
the way of thinking about solving the problem
procedural, oop, functional

----------------------------------------------------------

low level languages - high level languages.

low level languages:
                self managed memory.

high level languages:
                language managed memory.

--------------------------------------------------------

compiled vs interpreted

compiled:
            compilation -> machine code.
            faster execution.
            very few runtime exceptions.

interpreted:
            line by line execution
            slower execution.
            a lot of runtime exceptions.

-------------------------------------------------------

statically typed vs dynamically typed

statically typed:
        int x


dynamically typed:
        x = 5

----------------------------------------------------

weakly typed vs strongly typed
cohersion

weakly typed:
        int x = 97;
        printf("%c", x);    = a

        js:
            my string5

strongly typed:
        x = "my string"
        y = 5
        print(x + y)
